**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TreasureMapModal.tsx` (enhanced getHintText function)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ContextualHint.tsx` (new component for on-page hints)

**Enhancement 1: Multi-Level Treasure Map Hints**

Replaced generic hints with detailed progressive system:

**Code 1 (SPOOKY10) - 3 Hint Levels:**
- Level 0: "Explore the page to unlock hints..."
- Level 1: "Remember classic video game cheat codes from the 90s?"
- Level 2: "The Konami Code was famous in games like Contra..."

- Level 0: "Keep engaging to unlock hints..."
- Level 1: "Emily's photos aren't just decorative..."
- Level 2: "Try hovering (or tapping on mobile) over Emily's images slowly..."
- Level 3+: Full hint

**Code 3 (ENCHANTED50) - 4 Hint Levels:**
- Level 0: "This one requires serious dedication..."
- Level 1: "Complete maximum engagement across the entire page first..."
- Level 2: "Try every interactive element, read every section, scroll to the bottom..."
- Level 3: "Check the page corners, the footer, unexpected places..."
- Level 4+: Full hint

**Engagement Gate Messages:**
When user hasn't reached required engagement score:
- Code 1: "Requires 0 engagement points" (no gate)
- Code 2: "Requires 8 engagement points. Current: X. Try the quiz, flip cards, and value slider!"
- Code 3: "Requires 15 engagement points. Current: X. This is the ultimate challenge‚Äîexplore EVERYTHING! (X more points needed)"

**Enhancement 2: Contextual On-Page Hints**

Created `ContextualHint.tsx` component that displays floating hints based on:
- Time on page

- 180s + hint level 3: "Still looking? Try using your ARROW KEYS somewhere on this page..."

**Code 2 Not Found (after Code 1 found):**
- Engagement < 8: "Keep engaging! You need 8 engagement points to unlock the next hint."
- 8+ points, 180s: "Look for something hidden in the images..."
- 8+ points, 240s: "Still searching? Try HOVERING or TAPPING on Emily's photos..."

**Code 3 Not Found (after Code 2 found):**
- Engagement < 15: "Final code requires MAXIMUM engagement (15+ points). Current: X"
- 15+ points, 240s: "You're close! Explore EVERY section, corner, and interactive element..."
- 15+ points, 300s: "Last hint: Check unexpected places‚Äîpage corners, footer, anywhere you haven't clicked yet!"

**Component Features:**
- Dismissible (X button)

### Task 2.4: ‚úÖ Mobile Treasure Map Fixes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TreasureMapModal.tsx`

**Improvements:**

**1. Swipe-to-Dismiss Gesture**

Added touch event handlers for downward swipe:

```typescript
const [touchStart, setTouchStart] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [touchEnd, setTouchEnd] = useState<number | null>(null);
const minSwipeDistance = 100;

const onTouchStart = (e: React.TouchEvent) => {
  setTouchEnd(null);
  setTouchStart(e.targetTouches[0].clientY);
};

const onTouchMove = (e: React.TouchEvent) => {
  setTouchEnd(e.targetTouches[0].clientY);
};

const onTouchEnd = () => {
  if (!touchStart || !touchEnd) return;
  const distance = touchStart - touchEnd;
  const isDownSwipe = distance < -minSwipeDistance;
  if (isDownSwipe) setShowMap(false);
};
```

Applied to modal:
```tsx
<div
  onTouchStart={onTouchStart}
  onTouchMove={onTouchMove}
  onTouchEnd={onTouchEnd}
  className="... touch-pan-y"
>
```

**2. Swipe Indicator**

Visual cue for mobile users:
```tsx
<div className="md:hidden absolute top-2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 w-12 h-1 bg-slate-600 rounded-full" />
```

**3. Larger Touch Targets**

**Close Button:**
- Before: `p-2` (8px padding)
- After: `p-3 md:p-2` (12px mobile, 8px desktop)
- Icon: `w-7 h-7 md:w-6 md:h-6` (larger on mobile)

**CTA Button:**
- Before: `py-3`
- After: `py-4 md:py-3` (larger mobile padding)
- Added: `touch-manipulation` class (optimizes touch events)
- Font size: `text-base md:text-sm` (larger mobile)

**4. Click-Outside-to-Close**

Added overlay click handler:
```tsx
<div
  className="fixed inset-0 ..."
  onClick={() => setShowMap(false)}
>
  <div onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
    {/* Modal content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**UX Improvements:**
- More intuitive dismissal on mobile (swipe down)
- Visual feedback (swipe indicator bar)
- Easier button interactions (44px+ touch targets)
- Backdrop click to close

---

### Task 2.5: ‚úÖ Comprehensive App FAQs

**Location:** Before footer section
**Lines:** src/app/page.tsx (1430-1531)

**Created:** 6-question FAQ section answering iOS vs Web decision

**Section Structure:**

**Header:**
- Badge: "FAQ"
- Headline: "iOS App Store or Custom Web App?"
- Subheadline: Decision-making guide

**6 FAQs (HTML `<details>` elements):**

**FAQ 1: üí∞ Which option costs more?**
- iOS: $99/year Apple Developer (Emily covers first year with ultimate prize)
- Web: No app store fees, $10-30/month hosting
- Bottom line: Web apps cheaper long-term

**FAQ 2: ‚è∞ Which one launches faster?**
- iOS: 7-10 days Apple review process
- Web: Live in days, no approval needed
- Bottom line: Web app wins for speed

**FAQ 3: üì± Can people still "install" a web app on their phone?**
- Yes! Both iOS and Android support home screen installation
- Difference: App Store = discoverability, Web = control
- Bottom line: Both can live on home screens

**FAQ 4: üéØ Which one is better for credibility and branding?**
- iOS: Maximum "wow factor," App Store prestige
- Web: Impressive custom build, less prestige
- Bottom line: iOS for brand positioning

**FAQ 5: üîÑ Can I change my mind later?**
- Absolutely‚Äîcan convert either direction
- Core functionality same, just packaging differs
- Bottom line: Not locked in, can pivot

**FAQ 6: ü§î I'm still not sure which to choose. What do you recommend?**
- First call helps determine fit
- Rule of thumb:
  - iOS: credibility, long-term brand equity, willing to wait
  - Web: speed, flexibility, lower costs, full control
- Bottom line: Both work, Emily helps decide

**Interactive Design:**
- `<details>` elements with custom styling
- Expandable/collapsible (native HTML behavior)
- Arrow icon rotates on open (CSS: `group-open:rotate-180`)
- Hover effects: `hover:bg-slate-700/50`
- Consistent color coding:
  - Headers: white text, purple accent
  - Content: purple-200 text
  - "Bottom line": pink-300 emphasis

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML (`<details>` + `<summary>`)
- Keyboard navigable (native behavior)
- Screen reader friendly

---

### Task 2.6: ‚úÖ Darken Theme Further

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` (main container background)

**Change:**

**Before:**
```tsx
className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-950 via-purple-950/80 to-pink-950/40"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-black via-slate-950 to-slate-900"
```

**Effect:**
- Darker overall background
- Increased contrast for text readability
- More premium/sophisticated feel
- Better focus on interactive elements
- Reduced eye strain in dark environments

**Design Rationale:**
- Original theme had purple/pink tints that reduced contrast
- New theme: pure black ‚Üí slate-950 ‚Üí slate-900
- Maintains gradient depth without color distraction
- Interactive elements (purple/pink) pop more against darker background

---

### Task 2.7: ‚ö†Ô∏è App Mockup Images (Skipped)

**Status:** Requires actual image assets (not available in current session)

**Recommendation for later:**
- Add iOS app mockup images (iPhone screenshots)
- Add web app mockup images (browser/mobile views)
- Use `<Image>` component from next/image for optimization
- Position in BFF App Showcase section
- Add to AppChoiceCards as visual aids

**Placeholder approach (if needed):**
```tsx
<div className="aspect-[9/19] bg-slate-800 rounded-3xl border-4 border-slate-700 flex items-center justify-center">
  <p className="text-slate-500">App Mockup</p>
</div>
```

---

### Task 2.8: ‚úÖ Social Proof Section (Existing)

**Status:** Already implemented in testimonials section (lines 1320-1428)

**No additional changes needed.** Existing implementation includes:
- Multiple testimonial cards
- Before/after results
- Industry variety
- Disclaimer text

---

## Phase 3 - Polish & Quality Assurance

2. **ARIA Labels:**
   - Close buttons: `aria-label="Close modal"`
   - Interactive elements properly labeled
   - Decorative elements: `aria-hidden="true"`

3. **Keyboard Navigation:**
