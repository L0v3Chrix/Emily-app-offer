```

**New Hero:**
```
Headline: "Your Business Deserves Its Own App"

Subheadline (3 lines):
- "Whether you've always dreamed of seeing your name in the Apple App Store"
- "or want a custom web app that works like magic‚Äî"

Tagline: "Every entrepreneur has an app inside of them. Let's build yours."
```

### Task 0.5: ‚úÖ Progressive Reward System Clarity
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TreasureMapModal.tsx`

**Changes:**

**Treasure Data Structure:**
Added explicit discount tracking to each treasure:
```typescript
{
  code: 'SPOOKY10',
  discount: 10,      // THIS code gives 10%
  cumulative: 10     // TOTAL if you found all before this
}
{
  code: 'HAUNTED20',
  discount: 20,      // THIS code gives 20%
  cumulative: 30     // TOTAL so far: 10% + 20% = 30%
}
{
  code: 'ENCHANTED50',
  discount: 20,      // THIS code gives 20%
  cumulative: 50     // TOTAL: 10% + 20% + 20% = 50%
}
```

**Header Messaging:**
Added prominent explanation:
```
üí∞ Discounts stack: 10% + 20% + 20% = 50% OFF!
```

**Chest Display:**
Changed from showing total percentage to showing incremental:
- Old: "50% OFF" (confusing - made it look like one code = 50%)
- New: "+20% OFF" with "(Total: 50% if you find all before)"

**Victory Message:**
Enhanced all-codes-found message:
```
üéâ ALL CODES FOUND!
TOTAL: 50% OFF!
10% (SPOOKY10) + 20% (HAUNTED20) + 20% (ENCHANTED50) = 50% Friends & Family Rate
```

**Verification:** Progressive reward system now clearly communicates additive nature of discounts, avoiding confusion about "spell them all to get more money."
